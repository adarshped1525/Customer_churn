Customer Churn Rate Prediction

Overview

This project focuses on predicting customer churn using machine learning techniques. Churn prediction helps businesses identify customers who are likely to leave and take proactive measures to retain them.

Features

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming raw customer data.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identifying trends and patterns in customer behavior.

Feature Engineering: Selecting and creating meaningful features for prediction.

Model Selection & Training: Implementing various machine learning models for accurate churn prediction.

Model Evaluation: Measuring performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC.

Insights & Recommendations: Providing actionable insights to reduce churn rates.

Technologies Used

Python

Jupyter Notebook

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Installation

Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/Customer_Churn_Prediction.git

Navigate to the project directory:

cd Customer_Churn_Prediction

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Open the Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook Customer_churn_rate_prediction.ipynb

Usage

Run each cell in the Jupyter Notebook to preprocess data, train models, and evaluate results.

Modify parameters and algorithms to experiment with different approaches.

Use the final model to predict churn on new customer data.

Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains customer details such as demographics, purchase history, and engagement metrics. Ensure the dataset is available in the specified path before running the notebook.

Results

The notebook provides visual insights and predictive models to understand customer churn trends.

Performance metrics help evaluate model effectiveness.

Actionable recommendations are derived based on predictions.
